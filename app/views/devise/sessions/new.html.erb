    <p>GOAT Alpha is used to coordinate scholarships for GOAT trips and to communication and confirm scheduled trips and details to group leaders. For all trips scheduled, the information on your trip plan will be the final confirmation.</p>
    <p>If you are a group leader looking for your trips or trip plan, you do not need to login to view details - this area is only for GOAT staff to schedule trips. Please look for your custom link in your email.</p>
    <p>If you need our waiver, you can check your trip plan or <a href="http://goattrips.org/pdfs/GOAT-Release.pdf">Download our waiver here</a></p>
    <p>For any other questions, please contact our program staff.</p>
